Can you now see my s3 buckets

---

I can help you check your S3 buckets. Let me run the AWS CLI command to list them.

---

Listing all S3 buckets in the AWS account to show the user their available buckets.

---

shell

---

Checking if AWS CLI is installed and finding its location.

---

shell

---


AWS CLI is not installed in your environment. You'll need to either:

1. Install AWS CLI:
```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

2. Or use the AWS Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/

Based on your README, you should have at least these buckets:
- `twin-wicks.com` (frontend hosting)
- A receipts bucket (name configured in Lambda environment variables)

Would you like me to help you install the AWS CLI?

---

See if AWS is configured properly now

---

Checking if AWS CLI is now available and configured.

---

shell

Yes, AWS is configured properly. Your S3 buckets are:

**Expense Tracker buckets:**
- `expense-tracker-frontend-391907191624`
- `expense-tracker-receipts-prod-391907191624`
- `expense-tracker-prod-serverlessdeploymentbucket-4yhal95lp0a7`

**Frontend hosting:**
- `twin-wicks.com`
- `www.twin-wicks.com`

**Other projects:**
- `coretalent.pro`
- `explorespeak.com` / `www.explorespeak.com`
- `teckstart.com`
- `yoururbanlifestyle.com`
- Various intake/upload buckets
- SAM CLI and Serverless Framework deployment buckets

---

Let&#39;s work on teckstart.com please

---

I can help you work on teckstart.com. Let me check what's currently in that S3 bucket.

---

Listing the contents of the teckstart.com S3 bucket to see what files are currently hosted.

---

shell

The teckstart.com bucket contains a web application with:
- HTML, JS, and CSS files (with cache-busting timestamps)
- Chart.js library
- OAuth/auth components
- Dashboard functionality
- Favicon and app icons
- Logo image

What would you like to do with teckstart.com? For example:
- Review or modify the code
- Update specific files
- Check the site configuration
- Deploy new changes
- Something else?

---

Review the code please

---


I will scan the entire code for the following files:
- index.html
- app-1764381275.js
- config-1764381275.js
- dashboard-1764381275.js
- oauth-1764381275.js

Downloading all the code files from the teckstart.com S3 bucket to review them.

```shell
mkdir -p teckstart-review && cd teckstart-review && aws s3 cp s3://teckstart.com/index.html . && aws s3 cp s3://teckstart.com/app-1764381275.js . && aws s3 cp s3://teckstart.com/config-1764381275.js . && aws s3 cp s3://teckstart.com/dashboard-1764381275.js . && aws s3 cp s3://teckstart.com/oauth-1764381275.js . && aws s3 cp s3://teckstart.com/styles-1764381275.css . && aws s3 cp s3://teckstart.com/auth-callback.html .
